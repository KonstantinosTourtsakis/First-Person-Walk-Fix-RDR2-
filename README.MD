# First Person Walk Fix (Red Dead Redemption 2)
Source code of my First Person Walk Fix mod for Red Dead Redemption 2

## Description
This is the source code of my Red Dead Redemption 2 mod "First Person Walk Fix". The source code has been released for educational purposes. New modders can learn from the source and understand modding from the code.

## Mod Description
This mod enables walking right after the player stops. Normally, the player starts jogging instead of walking and the user needs to press `Shift` in order to return to the walking state. In other words, walking works like in 3rd person mode using this mod.

## Source information
The source code is built on top of the "Pools" source provided with Alexander Blade's ScriptHookSDK. I'm using that same Project name because I sometimes work on multiple mods at the same time, so reloading scripts is easier and safer due to the fact that there is only one mod installed during that specific game session. Therefore, the compiled .asi file is named Pools.asi. The file can be renamed later.

## Installation
#### Requirements: [Alexander Blade's ScriptHookRDR2](http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/)
- Copy "Pools.asi" file under `/samples/Pools/bin/Release/` directory to your Red Dead Redemption 2 game folder.
- Done!
